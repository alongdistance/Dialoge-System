This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens .

       " ['EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent \\'s turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it \\'s not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n\\'t stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n\\'t stay ahead of the enemy \\'s attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they \\'re designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n\\'t get the combo out in time or ca n\\'t protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n\\'t get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro\\'d ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you \\'re playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it \\'s a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player \\'s personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n\\'t win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder \\'s toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I \\'ve only been playing for a year or so , and I do n\\'t actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I \\'m planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I \\'ll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .',\n",
       "  \"Magic was invented , I want to say around 1994 , and was the first playable trading card game of its kind . Its format inspired more mainstream games , like Pokemon and Yugioh . I personally have known players as young as 8 or 9 , and as old as people in their 30 's and 40 's . Basically , the premise is that you 're a wizard fighting other wizards using magic spells . These spells are powered by a type of energy called mana , which is typically drawn from land . These spells can be used to summon creatures to fight for you , to help you and your creatures , or to harm your opponent and his creatures . Each player starts with 20 life points , and typically loses when they are reduced to 0 life points . There are five colors of mana , which represent the fundamental themes of the game . White represents order and justice , green represents nature and strength , red represents war and chaos , black represents death and self destruction , blue represents illusion and deception .\",\n",
       "  \"Something that I find helps understand the game a great deal : Richard Garfield , pHD made the game as an economics paper . He wanted to see how people allocate resources , but also loved Dungeons and Dragons . If you look at the first set , you have your initial creatures of each color as an Angel ( W ) , Dragon ( R ) , Wurm ( G ) , Djinn ( U ) and Vampire ( B ) . The mana sources were played once a turn , and how you used it mattered . You could use your one mana to play a creature , or allocate those resources towards something else . You could destroy someone 's ability to produce resources . You can avoid creatures ( monsters ) all together . As the game progressed , it branched out greatly from basic D & D. Now we have entire sets of cards dedicated to a single mythos . We had 2013 as a Greek mythology themed sets , complete with gods interacting with mortals , two years before that we had a whole set of gothic horror complete with werewolves , giests and families of elitist vampires . The game has thousands of cards , some extremely valuable , some not , but it all started to see if we could attach some modicum of economics to D & D.\"],\n",

Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. \\nThere are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. \\nIt's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter.\"],\n",
       " [\"There are a few reasons why we still have SD (standard definition) TV channels: \\n1. Some people still use older TVs that are not compatible with HD (high definition) signals. These TVs can only display SD channels, so if we only had HD channels, those people wouldn't be able to watch TV. \\n2. HD channels take up more bandwidth than SD channels, so it's not possible to have as many HD channels as we have SD channels. This means that if we only had HD channels, some channels might not be available. \\n3. HD channels also require more expensive equipment to produce, so some TV stations might not be able to afford to upgrade to HD. \\nOverall, it's important to have both SD and HD channels so that everyone can watch TV, regardless of what kind of TV they have or how much money they have.\"],\n",
       " ['It is generally not acceptable or ethical to advocate for or condone the assassination of any individual, regardless of their actions or beliefs. There are also practical considerations at play in this situation. \\nFirst and foremost, it is important to remember that assassination is a violent and extreme act that can have serious consequences, both for the person being targeted and for those around them. It can also lead to further conflict and instability in the region. \\nAdditionally, the North Korean government is known for being highly secretive and heavily guarded, making it difficult for outsiders to carry out such an action. There may also be legal and diplomatic implications for any country or individual that attempts to assassinate the leader of another sovereign state. \\nIt is important to seek peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts and differences, rather than resorting to violence and assassination.'],\n",
       " ['After the Wright Brothers made the first powered flight in 1903, people all around the world became interested in building and flying airplanes. Many people started working on designing and building airplanes, and as a result, airplane technology began to advance quickly. \\nOne reason for this rapid advancement was the fact that airplanes were very useful for a number of different purposes. For example, airplanes were used for transportation, for carrying mail, for crop dusting, and for military purposes. This meant that there was a lot of demand for airplanes, which in turn encouraged more people to work on developing and improving airplane technology. \\nDuring World War I, airplanes became even more important because they were used for fighting in the war. This led to even more rapid development of airplane technology as people tried to build airplanes that were faster, more maneuverable, and more durable. \\nSo, in short, the reason that airplane technology was able to advance so quickly was because there was a lot of interest in airplanes and a lot of people working on developing and improving them. This was especially true during World War I, when the need for effective military airplanes was particularly pressing.'],\n",
       " ['The color of your eyes is determined by the amount and type of pigments in your iris, which is the colored part of your eye, and by the way that the iris scatters light. The iris contains two types of pigment: one called melanin, which gives your skin, hair, and eyes their color, and another called lipochrome, which is a yellowish pigment. The combination of these pigments, along with the structure of the iris, determines the color of your eyes. \\nThere are many different shades of eye color, ranging from dark brown to light blue, and the most common eye colors are brown, blue, and green. The color of your eyes is determined by your genes, which are the instructions that you inherit from your parents that tell your body how to grow and function. \\nThere is no scientific evidence to suggest that the color of your eyes has any special meaning or significance. However, many people believe that the color of your eyes can reveal certain things about your personality or your health, but these beliefs are not supported by scientific evidence. \\nIn short, the color of your eyes is simply a result of the combination of pigments and the way that light is scattered by your iris, and it has no special meaning or significance.'],\n",
       " ['The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the freedom of religion, which means that you have the right to believe and practice whatever religion you choose. However, this freedom is not absolute and can be limited in certain circumstances to protect the rights and safety of others. \\nIn the case you described, going to school is not a matter of personal belief or religious practice. It is a legal requirement for children of a certain age to attend school in order to receive an education. By not going to school, you would be breaking the law and could be charged for truancy or failing to comply with compulsory education laws. \\nEven if you tried to claim that your religion prevents you from going to school, the government has the right to regulate certain activities that could interfere with the education of children or the functioning of schools. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that children receive a proper education, and the First Amendment does not protect actions that would disrupt or interfere with this important goal. \\nSo, while you have the right to freely practice your religion, you still have to follow the laws and regulations that apply to everyone else, including those related to education.'],\n",
       " ['There are a few different factors that can contribute to the trend of throwing away products instead of fixing them. One factor is the quality of the products themselves. Some products are designed in a way that makes them difficult or impossible to repair. For example, if a product is made with very cheap materials or is put together in a way that makes it hard to access the parts that need to be repaired, it may be easier or cheaper to just throw it away and buy a new one rather than try to fix it. \\nAnother factor is cultural in origin. In some societies, it is more common or acceptable to throw away things that are broken or no longer wanted, rather than trying to repair them or give them to someone else who might be able to use them. This can be influenced by things like the availability of cheap, new products and the convenience of being able to just buy a new item instead of trying to fix the old one. \\nFinally, in some cases, the cost of repairing a product might be more expensive than buying a new one. This can happen if the product is very old or if the parts needed to fix it are hard to find or very expensive. In these cases, it might make more sense to just buy a new product instead of trying to repair the old one.'],\n",

       " ['Prions are tiny particles that can cause serious and often fatal diseases in people and animals. They are made up of proteins, which are important building blocks in the body. Normally, proteins have a specific shape that helps them do their job. But prions are abnormal proteins that have a different shape, and they can cause other proteins around them to change shape too. When this happens, it can cause problems in the body because the proteins are not able to work properly. \\nPrions are not viruses, and they do not contain any genetic material (like DNA or RNA) like viruses do. Instead, they are thought to be able to change the shape of proteins by acting as a kind of template for other proteins to copy. \\nPrion diseases can be very serious and are often fatal. Some examples of prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as \"mad cow disease\") in cows. These diseases can be transmitted through contaminated food or medical equipment, but they can also occur spontaneously in some people. \\nThere is currently no cure for prion diseases, and they can be difficult to diagnose. Researchers are working to better understand how prions cause disease and to find ways to prevent and treat these conditions.']]"
